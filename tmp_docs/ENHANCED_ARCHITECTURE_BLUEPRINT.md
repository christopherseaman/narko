# Enhanced File Upload/Embedding System Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive architectural design for enhancing the narko file upload and embedding system. The architecture focuses on performance, scalability, intelligent content processing, and seamless integration with Notion API and Tiny Obsidian.

## Current System Analysis

### Strengths of Current Implementation
- **Solid Foundation**: Well-structured marko extension system with custom blocks
- **File Type Support**: Comprehensive support for 25+ file types including images, documents, and code
- **Notion Integration**: Direct API integration with proper authentication and error handling
- **Caching System**: Basic deduplication using file hashes with persistent cache storage
- **Content Extraction**: Text extraction from common file types for embedding generation

### Identified Limitations
- **Synchronous Processing**: Single-threaded file processing creates bottlenecks
- **Memory Management**: Large files can cause memory spikes during processing
- **Limited Text Extraction**: Basic extraction for complex file types (PDF, DOCX)
- **No Semantic Understanding**: Missing advanced content analysis and relationship mapping
- **Basic Error Handling**: Limited retry logic and recovery mechanisms

## Phase 1: Performance Architecture (Priority: High)

### Asynchronous File Processing
```python
class AsyncFileProcessor:
    def __init__(self, max_workers=5, queue_size=100):
        self.semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_workers)
        self.upload_queue = asyncio.Queue(maxsize=queue_size)
        self.progress_callbacks = []
    
    async def process_batch(self, files: List[Path]) -> BatchResult:
        """Process multiple files concurrently with progress tracking"""
        tasks = []
        for file_path in files:
            task = self.process_single_file(file_path)
            tasks.append(task)
        
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

### Memory-Efficient Streaming
- **Chunked Processing**: Process large files in 1MB chunks
- **Lazy Loading**: Load file metadata only when needed
- **Garbage Collection**: Explicit cleanup of temporary objects
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track and limit memory usage during batch operations

### Performance Targets
- **Throughput**: 50 files/minute for typical documents
- **Latency**: < 2s for files under 1MB
- **Memory**: < 500MB peak memory usage during batch uploads
- **Reliability**: < 1% failure rate under normal conditions

## Phase 2: Enhanced Embedding System

### Multi-Modal Content Extraction
```python
class ContentExtractor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.extractors = {
            '.pdf': PDFTextExtractor(),
            '.docx': DocxTextExtractor(), 
            '.png': OCRImageExtractor(),
            '.py': CodeStructureExtractor()
        }
    
    async def extract_content(self, file_path: Path) -> ExtractedContent:
        """Extract rich content with metadata"""
        extractor = self.get_extractor(file_path)
        return await extractor.extract(file_path)
```

### Advanced Text Extraction
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2/pdfplumber for comprehensive text extraction
- **Document Processing**: python-docx for Word documents with formatting preservation  
- **Image OCR**: pytesseract/easyocr for text extraction from images
- **Code Analysis**: AST parsing for structure and documentation extraction

### Vector Storage System
- **Embedding Models**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 or local alternatives
- **Storage Backend**: ChromaDB for vector storage with SQLite metadata
- **Indexing Strategy**: Hierarchical organization by content type and temporal indexing
- **Similarity Search**: Fast semantic search with configurable similarity thresholds

## Phase 3: Scalability Architecture

### Distributed Processing
```python
class DistributedCoordinator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.worker_nodes = {
            'file_processors': [],
            'embedding_generators': [],
            'upload_coordinators': []
        }
        self.load_balancer = LoadBalancer()
        self.message_queue = RedisQueue()
```

### High-Volume Processing
- **Worker Nodes**: Specialized processors for different file types
- **Load Balancing**: Capacity-based routing with content-aware distribution
- **Message Queue**: Redis/RabbitMQ for job distribution and status tracking
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic worker creation based on queue length

### Fault Tolerance
- **Circuit Breaker**: API rate limiting with intelligent backoff
- **Redundancy**: Multiple upload paths and data replication
- **Recovery**: Checkpoint system with transaction logging
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health assessment with auto-recovery

## Phase 4: Integration Architecture

### Notion API Optimization
```python
class NotionAPIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.connection_pool = ConnectionPool(max_connections=10)
        self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter(requests_per_second=3)
        self.retry_handler = RetryHandler(max_attempts=3)
        
    async def batch_upload(self, files: List[FileUpload]) -> BatchResult:
        """Optimized batch upload with connection reuse"""
        async with self.rate_limiter:
            return await self._execute_batch(files)
```

### Tiny Obsidian Integration
- **Markdown Compatibility**: Support for [[wikilinks]], tags, and embeds
- **Vault Structure**: Map Obsidian folders to Notion page hierarchy  
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Monitor changes in both systems with conflict resolution
- **Template Support**: Handle Obsidian templates and variables

### Plugin Extension System
- **Modular Design**: Pluggable components for different file types
- **Extension Points**: Hooks for custom processing logic
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration for different use cases

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Observability Stack
```python
class MetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_metrics = PerformanceTracker()
        self.usage_analytics = UsageAnalyzer()
        self.cost_tracker = CostMonitor()
        
    def collect_metrics(self) -> SystemMetrics:
        """Comprehensive system metrics collection"""
        return SystemMetrics(
            performance=self.performance_metrics.get_current(),
            usage=self.usage_analytics.analyze_patterns(),
            costs=self.cost_tracker.calculate_current()
        )
```

### Key Metrics
