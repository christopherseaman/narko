# Notion API Test Results

## API Key Status
- **Environment**: ✅ API key loaded from `.env`
- **Length**: 50 characters (expected format)
- **Import Root**: `23ad9fdd1a1a809cb1c0c842794d9176`

## Test Results

### Basic Page Operations
- **Read Access**: ✅ Working (MCP connection confirmed)
- **Write Access**: ✅ Working (page creation successful)
- **Created Test Page**: https://www.notion.so/test_upload-248d9fdd1a1a813ba36df321cb5ae00e

### File Upload Operations
- **File Upload API**: ❌ **401 Unauthorized**
- **Error**: "API token is invalid" for file upload endpoint
- **Root Cause**: API key lacks file upload permissions

## Analysis

The current API integration token has:
- ✅ Page read permissions
- ✅ Page write permissions  
- ❌ **Missing file upload permissions**

## Required Actions

1. **Update API Key Permissions**: The integration needs additional scopes:
   - `files:write` - Upload files to Notion
   - `files:read` - Access uploaded files
   
2. **Integration Configuration**: Update the Notion integration to include file permissions

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Use external file hosting (GitHub, AWS S3) with links
   - Implement embedding without file uploads
   - Request permission upgrade from workspace admin

## Next Steps

The file upload functionality is implemented correctly in the code, but requires updated API permissions to function.
